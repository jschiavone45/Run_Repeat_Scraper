2 reasons not to buy
The 12mm heel offset may not appeal to serious and elite racers.
A few runners wanted better arch support from the Adidas Modulate.
Bottom line
The Adidas Climacool Modulate aims to mix minimalist features with traditional ones. One either loves or hates the shoe as it seems to represent the features in their extremes. While it is often called light as air, very flexible, and with almost no arch support, it also has a rather high stack height and a whopping 12mm offset. And just like the popular Adidas Ultraboost 19 is an excellent shoe for the right runner as the durability, performance, and price of this shoe is simply hard to match."
